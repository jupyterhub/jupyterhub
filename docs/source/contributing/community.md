# Community communication channels

```{note}
Our community is distributed across the world in various timezones, so please be patient if you do not get a response immediately!
```

We use different channels of communication for different purposes. Whichever one you use will depend on what kind of communication you want to engage in.  These channels are detailed in the [JupyterHub Team Compass Contribution Guide](https://compass.hub.jupyter.org/contribute/guide/#get-connected).
