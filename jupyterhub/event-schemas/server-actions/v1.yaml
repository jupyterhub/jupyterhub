title: JupyterHub server events
description: |
  Record actions on user servers made via JupyterHub.

  JupyterHub can perform various actions on user servers via 
  direct interaction from users, or via the API. This event is 
  recorded whenever either of those happen.

  Limitations:

  1. This does not record all server starts / stops, only those
     explicitly performed by JupyterHub. For example, a user's server
     can go down because the node it was running on dies. That will
     not cause an event to be recorded, since it was not initiated
     by JupyterHub. In practice this happens often, so this is not
     a complete record.
  2. Events are only recorded when an action succeeds.
type: object
required:
- action
- username
- servername
properties:
  action:
    enum:
    - start
    - stop
    description: |
      Action performed by JupyterHub.

      This is a required field.

      Possibl Values:

      1. start
         A user's server was successfully started
      
      2. stop
         A user's server was successfully stopped
  username:
    type: string
    description: |
      Name of the user whose server this action was performed on.

      This is the normalized name used by JupyterHub itself,
      which is derived from the authentication provider used but 
      might not be the same as used in the authentication provider.
  servername:
    type: string
    description: |
      Name of the server this action was performed on.

      JupyterHub supports each user having multiple servers with
      arbitrary names, and this field specifies the name of the
      server.

      The 'default' server is denoted by the empty string
